  <p>You back away, afraid of the thing lying there. How do you know it won't try to harm you? Better safe than sorry, nooooo thanks.
  <br />You turn your back. And, well, that's not always a good thing, now is it?</p>
  <h1><em>Farewell, then.</em></h1>
  <p>You get torn apart by the trees, bark moving and leaves quivering as they strip the flesh from your bones.
  <br />You turn your head, and you see the trees take your skin and lay it on the deer. Its mushroom eyes leer at you, your face twisted horrendously to accomodate the deer's facial structure. You want to laugh, but they stripped your mouth.
  <br />You settle for dying.</p>
  <p>Did you really think you'd make it out alive? What a joke. You were dead from the moment you woke up.</p>
