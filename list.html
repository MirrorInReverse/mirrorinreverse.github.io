 <li>I think mythology is very neat. Since this is my webpage and I get to decide what it's about, I want this to be about mythology</li>
 <li>I could talk about Zeus and his many, many children, but I will not</li>
 <li>I could maybe talk about the Egyptians, how some are very coup happy, but I will not.</li>
 <li>Or I could talk about Polynesian mythology, and how they're zero percent problematic compared to the Greeks, but I shan't</li>
 <li> What I am going to to talk about then, is the Mesoamerican mythos!</li>
 <li>That's right, this indulgent webpage is about the Mayans, Aztecs, Olmecs, and all the others! Huzzah!!</li>
