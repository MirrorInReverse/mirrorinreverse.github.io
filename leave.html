  <p>You stumble your way out of the clearing, wobbling blindly to both sides. It is only with the prodding of the voice that you are able to not fall. The further you are away from that clearing and paper, the better you feel. Eventually, your headache begins to reduce, until it is gone completely. You keep wandering, having grown used to the eerie silence of both the Guardian and the wind. Almost like an old friend, you muse.
  <br />Your musings are cut short when you stumble upon a deer, except... this deer is... off. The deer-like creature has its lower half resting on the ground, its flesh melted and exposing the bones underneath. The face had mushrooms growing out of its eyes, and the deer opens its mouth to let out a cry.
  <br />Its scream is overlapped, a woman and toddler shrieking together.
  <br />You clamp your eyes shut and cover your ears, horrified at the sound it was making. The sound tapers off, and the deer stops. 
  <br />Instead, it stares at you with wide, mushroom-blind eyes and antlers potruding from its nose. The deer(?) grins at you, mouth stretching and splitting its face in half, and rows of teeth clink at you.</p>
  <h1><em>It is in pain. What will you do?</em></h1>
  <p>In pain? That thing? It was scaring you just looking at it, but you suppose it can't control it. Still, what are you going to do...?</p>
