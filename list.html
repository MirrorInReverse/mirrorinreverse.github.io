    <ul>
    <li>Pre-hispanic colonies were various civilizations at one point in time. The oldest were the Olmecs, and although little is known about them, they did leave behind giant heads. They were assumed to be in the region southeast of Veracruz and west of Tabasco (The Gulf of Mexico, basically).</li>
     <li>While this was the first recorded civilizaton, it wasn't the last. Another colossal civilization were the Mayans (of course), whose territory strethced from Yucatan; Campeche; Quintana Roo; part of Tabasco and Chiapas; Peten and Izabal (both in Guatemala); Northeast Honduras and Belize.</li>
     <li>Another famous one were the Incas. These people were concentrated mainly in Cusco, though their influence reached from Peru (obviously); Ecuador; the north of Argentina and Chile; west of Bolivia and south of Colombia.</li>
      <li>Of course, I wasn't going to <strong>not</strong> mention one of the most well known civilizations of all time, now was I? That's right, the <em>Aztecs.</em> One of the broadest civilizations that spanned from present day Mexico to the Gulf of Mexico, and even had some reach in the coast of the Pacific Ocean.</li>
     <li> Naturally there are more than these four, such as the Toltecas and their affinity for agriculture; the Tarahumaras and their light feet; the Totonacas with their flying and so many more, but then that'd take a long time. No no, I will only be focusing on these four, since they're the most well-known.</li>
