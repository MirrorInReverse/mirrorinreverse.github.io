    <h1><em>Hello. You're awake.</em></h1>
    <p class="fancy">You're in the middle of brushing off your clothes, having found them covered with dirt. Your pocket feels heavy, but the voice rings out before you can investigate, and so you lift your head up quickly and alarmed, looking around wildly for the source of the voice. The voice laughs, an echoing sound that shakes the leaves on the trees and rustles the grass, rattling inside your ribcage uncomfortably.
    <br />The voice laughs eerily at you, sending cold shivers down your spine. 
      <br />It feels like someone's walking on your grave</p>
    <h1><em>Ahem. I do apologize, it has been a while since another human has been in this forest, you see. I had not wished to alarm you. I shall introduce myself, then. I am the Guardian of this forest, and you seem to be lost. What is your name, little lost one?</em></h1>
    <p>You spin around three times, but no person is coming forth. The Guardian chuckles again.</p>
    <h1><em>Oh little human, I am not corporeal. Peace, and offer me your name.</em></h1>
    <p>You hesitantly offer your name up, and the Guardian makes a pleased hum that weighs on your shoulders, and falls silent.
      <br /> Now that there is no creepy voice crooning in your ear, you can finally take stock of your surroundings. A bit warily, you look down at yourself, and see that you are wearing the same clothes you had on this morning.
      <br />You don't really care about that, though. You're more concerned about what is in your pockets. You reach into your pocket, and are suddenly aware of how... <em>silent</em> the forest is. There are no birds chirping merrily, or the sound of sudden wind gusts. In fact, everything is unnervingly silent.
      <br />Your heart begins to thud against your chest, an overwhelming urge to just... <em>leave</em> envelops you whole. Your fists clench involuntarily.
      <br />Something sharp digs into your palms.
      <br />You blink, and the mood vanishes. The forest is still eerie and silent, but, you don't panic anymore. Instead, you bring your hand out of your pocket, slowly uncurling your hand to stare at what hurt you. 
      <br />In your hand you hold five... teeth (and oh, oh <em>no</em>, your breathing picks up because where did you find the teeth had they always been there they couldn't have gotten there unless you grabbed them but why did you grab them did someone else grab them but why give them to you or maybe you had them already they're dry and the blood is dry and it's not peeling off--)
    <hr />Your head throbs and you remember someone--</p>
  <h1><em>Hey now, please, I implore you do not go and heave up your intestines in my forest floor.</em></h1>
  <p>The voice of the Guardian calms you down, and you're able to focus on something other than the gleaming gnarled teeth. The Guardian starts humming, the heavy timbre drowning out the panicking voice in your head. You feel grateful.
    <br />Your able to look down without wanting to vomit, and you furrow your brow, because you have a long, thin white... bone. You have a bone in your pocket.
