  <h1><em>Again?! You're dead again?! Hilarious!! HAHAHAHA!!!!</em></h1>
  <p>You remembered the infinite loops through the forest, the Deer, the teeth, the bones. You remember the feeling of having your arms ripped out of your sockets. Obviously, the pain of remembering is too much for you. You die.</p>
