    <h1><em>Hello. You're awake.</em></h1>
    <p class="fancy">You're brushing off your clothes, having found them covered with dirt. Your pocket feels heavy, but the voice rings out before you can investigate, and so you lift your head up quickly and alarmed, looking around wildly for the source of the voice. The voice laughs, an echoing sound that rattles the leaves on the trees and rustles the grass.
    <br />You get the feeling someone walked over your grave, violent shivers running through your body with that eerie laugh.</p>
    <h1><em>Ahem. I do apologize, it has been a while since another human has been in this forest, you see. I had not wished to alarm you. I shall introduce myself, then. I am the Guardian of this forest, and you seem to be lost. What is your name, little lost one?</em></h1>
