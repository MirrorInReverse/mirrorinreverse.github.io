  <p>You walk up to the twitching Deer. Grimacing a little, you slowly pick up a rock. If you drop it with enough force, it'll be quick.
  <br />You take a breath. <strong>Guardian, please watch over this creature, and may it finally be at rest.</strong>
  <br />You drop the rock.</p>
  <h1><em>Thank you, child.</em></h1>
  <p>You nod, and you are flooded by a bright light. Shielding your eyes, you turn, and see there is a tunnel leading out of the forest.</p>
  <h1><em>As I promised, the exit. You may go.</em></h1>
  <p>Without saying a word, you sprint into the light.</p>
  <h1><em>...I will see you when you wake up, restless spirit. May you one day be able to cross to somewhere else.
  <p>Before you pass, you remember. You were hiking. There was mud. You fell.
  <hr />You <em>died.</em></p>
